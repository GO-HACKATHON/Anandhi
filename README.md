# Anandhi
Anandhi is a college major recommendation system. Created in a form of Line chatbot.

Add Anandhi as your friend in LINE via this id: @kwu0775z

To ask for a major recommendation, ask Anandhi by texting, "Anandhi, minta rekomendasi jurusan dong" or "Anandhi, minta saran untuk jurusan kuliah dong".
Anandhi will ask you what subjects that you like or are interested in school, then she will give you major recommendation based on that information.

In case you do not know the major she recommends, or you want to know which university that the major is in, you can ask Anandhi by saying, "Anandi, mau nanya dong".
You can ask Anandhi questions like "Apa itu Teknik Pertambangan?" or "Dimana kampus yang ada jurusan Kriminologi?"

Tell Anandhi if you already choose one major, Anandhi will remember it and give some informations about that major someday. e.g: "Anandhi, aku pilih Teknik Informatika."

Anandhi is developed with the help of these framework and APIs:
